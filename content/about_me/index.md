Ever since I was little, I've always been drawn to technology. Something that started as simply watching Youtube tech review videos evolved into computer programming. I can't fully grasp what fueled my interest, but here is the picture of me pretending to know what I'm doing.

This young boy didn't even suspect he'd be sitting in the same pose 17 years later. The more things change, the more they stay the same. One day I'll recreate this picture, but all in good time.

### Work Experience

*June 2023 -- Present (London, UK)*

#### Software Engineer at THG

*April 2022 -- June 2023 (Manchester, UK)*

* Led a series of highly innovative and collaborative initiatives to bring checkout abandonment rate by 15%. Displayed ownership by communicating with multiple internal teams, gathering functional re- quirements, analyzing integration limitations of existing APIs and finding the most optimal and cost- effective solutions. Engineered and developed the Express Checkout feature, which enables custo- mers to purchase in fewer clicks and is exclusive to mobile applications and increased the checkout conversion rate up to 80% vs 60% via standard checkout.

* Integrated Apple Pay as a payment option, which resulted in a further increase in the checkout conver- sion rate up to 95%.

* Implemented and maintained a microservices-based Java Spring stack to power an industry-leading Subscriptions platform that handles over 1 million monthly subscriptions for more than 20 internal and external clients across the globe. The platform’s robust architecture and efficient design allow for seamless scaling and rapid feature development, providing clients with a top-of-the-line subscription experience.

#### Graduate Software Engineer at THG

*October 2021 -- March 2022 (Manchester, UK)*

I was entrusted with setting up the initial full-stack infrastructure with Flutter Web as the front-end platform and Google Firebase as the backend/cloud development platform.
* Set up the sandbox and production environments, which guarantee a seamless development and deployment workflow. It involves the linkage of the Flutter builds with the respective cloud environment, which in turn are linked to custom domains for sandbox and production usage. 
* Automated the way code management operations are handled in Bitbucket. I integrated CI / CD pipelines that improved code review stages and the deployment mechanisms to sandbox and production environments.
