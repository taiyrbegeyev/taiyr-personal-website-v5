### Hi, I'm Taiyr Begeyev

#### maker of things and photographer

I'm a 22-year-old Software Engineer and a Code Enthusiast. I'm currently based in Manchester, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

During the day, I work on building a seamless customer-centric e-commerce mobile platform at [THG](https://www.thg.com).

I'm someone with deep sensitivity to the beauty of art or nature. I love observing the world around me. Maybe that's partially the reason why I started pursuing [photography](/photography).

I also [write](/blog). Mostly about tech and life.
