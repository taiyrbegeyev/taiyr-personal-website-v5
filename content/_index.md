### Hi, I'm Taiyr Begeyev

#### maker of things and photographer

I'm a 24-year-old Software Engineer. I'm currently based in Manchester, UK 🇬🇧

During the day, as a Backend Software Engineer, I contribute to the development and scaling of [Zuora](https://www.zuora.com)'s Commerce platform, powering companies to thrive in the Subscription Economy.

I'm someone with deep sensitivity to the beauty of art or nature. I love observing the world around me. Maybe that's partially the reason why I started pursuing [photography](/photography).

I also [write](/blog). Mostly about tech and life.
